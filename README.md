Unlocking the secrets of the market, this Python script embarks on a journey through historical stock 
data from Yahoo Finance. With meticulous analysis and visualization, it unveils the patterns of price 
changes, the rhythm of volume trends, and the dance of moving averages. It delves deep into the 
essence of trends, revealing their frequencies and interconnections through correlation matrices. But its 
mission goes beyond mere observation; it measures the heartbeat of volatility and calculates the golden 
ratio of risk and return - the Sharpe ratios. And at the pinnacle of its prowess lies the computation of 
Value at Risk (VaR), a beacon guiding investors through the turbulent waters of uncertainty. With each 
line of code, it empowers the discerning investor to navigate the unpredictable seas of the stock market 
with confidence and clarity.
